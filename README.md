### *About the App* 
IceCreamSocial is a social media app somewhere between Twitter, Instagram, and the Food Network. Users can post recipes and photos of their favorite desserts. Navigating the website, both registered and non-registered users have access to view other registered users - also known as Ice Cream Socialites - as well as all of the recipes they have posted. In addition to posting and viewing posts from the IceCreamSocial community, users can comment on posts to let the original poster know how they feel about their post!

### *Technologies Used*
This application was built using the following technologies: Python/PostgreSQL/Flask/SQLAlchemy/React/React-Redux/Thunk/Node.js. 

The database was created/managed using PostgreSQL (psql), in tandem with Flask SQLAlchemy. A RESTful API was created and called on using Axios. Front-end was built out using React Redux (with mapping of dispatch and props) Thunk / Functional Components/ CSS / HTML & JSX. The server framework was built using Python Flask. Additional developer tools leveraged were VS Code, Github, Insomnia, and React-Rainbow for styling.
