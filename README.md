### *About the App* 
IceCreamSocial is a social media app somewhere between Twitter, Instagram, and the Food Network where users can post recipes and photos of their favorite desserts. By following other users, a user can build a customized feed that will allow them to view the content they want to view from the content providers they wish to follow. In addition to posting and following other users, users can comment on posts, as well as post reviews of those same recipes posts.

### *Technologies Used*
This application was built using the following technologies: Python/PostgreSQL/Flask/SQLAlchemy/React/React-Redux/Thunk/Node.js. 

The database was created/managed using PostgreSQL (psql), in tandem with Flask SQLAlchemy. A RESTful API was created and called on using Axios. Front-end was built out using React Redux (with mapping of dispatch and props) Thunk / Functional Components/ CSS / HTML & JSX. The server framework was built using Python Flask. Additional developer tools leveraged were VS Code, Github, Insomnia, and UX libraries.
